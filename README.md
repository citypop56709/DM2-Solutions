# DM2-Solutions
A series of small programs made to solve problems in my Discrete Math II class.

Program 1: Base Expansion
A very, very rudimentary program to convert any number in decimal to another number in base b. With b being any positive integer. This is the first iteration of this program,
the next one will include extra features like exception handling. This program was made to solve a problem in lesson 2.16 DM2.
